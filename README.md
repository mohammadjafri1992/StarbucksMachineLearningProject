## README FILE

This README file only applies to the Udacity Capstone Project - Starbucks

- This is a very simple project. Keep executing the notebook cells and you will be fine.
- If you want to load all imports at once, then here is a list of the libraries I used.

Notebook imports:

import pandas as pd\
import numpy as np\
import math\
import json\
from sklearn.preprocessing import MultiLabelBinarizer\
from datetime import datetime\
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelBinarizer\
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\
import seaborn as sns\
%matplotlib inline\
import os\
import re\
import progressbar\
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score, accuracy_score\
from sklearn.metrics import fbeta_score, make_scorer\
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV\
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier



- If you want to rerun my project and try to emulate the results, import the above libraries and keep executing the cells. You will be fine.
- The project is based on Python 3.6
- Make sure to upgrade to the latest version of Python and install the most up to date libraries.
